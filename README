INSTALL

I build it by setting GOPATH=$(pwd) and running 'go build editor'. You do you though.

ABOUT

This is a simple curses-based text editor in Go, with support only for editing and saving. It is based heavily on https://github.com/antirez/kilo, albeit with features stripped out to simplify the code further.

The primary goal was simplicity, not usability. As such it doesn't have a lot of utility as a text editor, but it is a good basis for exploring terminal editor development (At least for myself)
