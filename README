stued: simple terminal unicode editor

INSTALL

I build it by setting GOPATH=$(pwd) and running 'go build editor'. You do you.
It depends on libncursesw5 for the terminal handling bits.

USE

First off, probably just don't use it. If you do, it currently allows you to edit
and save files. Open a file by running 'stued <filename>'; you will start in edit
mode, and you can enter a command by pressing escape, the command, then enter.

Existing commands are:

    w:  save the file
    q:  quit (if file is saved or unmodified)
    q!: quit whether saved or not

ABOUT

This is a simple unicode-aware(ish) curses-based text editor; it doesn't have any
interesting features, and probably generally isn't useful.

The primary goal was simplicity, not usability. As such it doesn't have a lot of
utility as a text editor, but it is a good basis for exploring terminal
editor development (at least for myself).

I started by forking out from a smaller go editor I made based on the code in
https://github.com/antirez/kilo. I believe I have stripped out any code that
could be argued to be purely copied or only slightly altered, so I have not
included the (BSD-2) license from kilo. If you find some example showing this
to be an error, please let me know.
